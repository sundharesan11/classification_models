Credit card fraud detection using classification algorithms

Given the dataset, the objective of the model is to identify whether the transaction is fraud or not fraud.

To achieve this three classification models are developed using different algorithms.

They are: 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. Decision Tree
